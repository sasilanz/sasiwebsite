# sasiwebsite
My first own business website.
---
I am not a website-developer and not a great programmer, therefore i took a free bootstrap template from templatewire and a free html/css template from html5webtemplates.co.uk and adapted them to my needs. (thanks to both of them).
---
As i want to keep track of changes, i uploaded the code to github.
Feel free to reuse it.
with love
Astrid
